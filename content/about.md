**Tagline:**  
AI-powered search platform for government procurement opportunities.

**Problem Statement:**  
Finding relevant public procurement information can be time-consuming and difficult. Users often struggle with complex interfaces and keyword-based searches that don't match their natural way of asking questions.

**Our Solution:**  
We are building a publicly accessible web platform that simplifies searching for government procurement data. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI technologies, we enable users to find procurement opportunities using natural language queries.

**How It Works:**  
- We retrieve, process and index data to work with LLMs.
- You submit questions in plain English (e.g., "Show me IT contracts in California in Cybersecurity.").
- We return relevant, easy-to-understand results instantly.

**Key Benefits:**  
- Intuitive natural language search.
- Accessible to all users at low cost.
- Up-to-date information from official government sources.
- Saves time for private contractors and businesses seeking government contracts.

**Project Status:**  
This is a proof-of-concept project intended to demonstrate the value of AI-powered search for public procurement data.
